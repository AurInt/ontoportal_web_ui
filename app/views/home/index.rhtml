<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Welcome to the National Center for Biomedical Ontology BioPortal. BioPortal provides access to the Open Biomedical Ontologies repository ï¿½ a library of publicly accessible biomedical ontologies.</p>
<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>BioPortal allows users to browse, search, and visualize ontologies in the library.</p>
<h1>Browse The Library</h1>
<p>Users may browse the contents of the library and view the project details and metadata information of the ontology as well as the available versions. To download Download, visualize Visualize, or search Search a specific ontology select the appropriate icon in the action column.</p>

<p>In addition, users who are signed in may also submit an ontology to the library. Submissions to the library are reviewed.</p>

<h1>Search The Library</h1>
<p>Users may search ontology content across all ontologies, within certain ontologies or in a specific ontology in the library. As well as searching for class name or id, attributes such as synonyms can be queried. In addition to searching ontology content, users may also search ontology metadata which contains the project information of an ontology.</p>
