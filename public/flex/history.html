		<li>Added a warning dialog which gets displayed before a node is expanded IF it has more than 50 children</li>

		<!-- 2.0.5 October 2nd, 2008 -->
		<li>Some minor performance improvements</li>
		<li>Added a menu item under the Nodes menu which lets you choose which property to use for node labeling (e.g. Prefered_Name, rdfs:label, etc)</li>
		<li>Added shortcut keys for showing/focussing on the neighborhood (N) and hierarchy to root (H) of the selected node</li>
		<li>Changed the graph to now have a blue border when it is focussed</li>

		<li>Fixed the tree and grid layouts to ensure that a minimum separation of 20 pixels exists between each node</li>
		<li>Changed the graph to center on a focussed node <b>after</b> the layout animation has finished, it is smoother this way</li> 
		<!-- 2.0.3 August 26st, 2008 -->
		<li>Added a warning dialog when too many (>40 nodes) are going to be displayed on the screen, this warning can be turned off</li>
		<li>Improved the node and arc tooltip configuration (under the Node and Arc menus)</li>

		<li>Added a double click handler on the BasicFlexoViz which opens the direct link to the clicked concept in the current window</li>
		<li>Minor fixes to the vertical tree layout when there are multiple roots in the tree</li>
		<li>Added scroll-to-node support so that a single node can be centered in the screen when the graph has scrollbars</li>
		<li>Added all concept properties as a tooltip, including comments, definitions, synonyms, etc</li>
