# SEMrushBot [ https://www.semrush.com/bot ] does *not* have consistent naming, i.e. SEMrushBot, SemrushBot. In
# addition, there are multiple associated bots, i.e. SemrushBot-SA, SemrushBot-SI. User-agent-based wildcard [
# https://developers.google.com/search/reference/robots_txt#order-of-precedence-for-user-agents ] is used liberally -
# for brevity and future-proofing [ accounting for future associated bots ].
